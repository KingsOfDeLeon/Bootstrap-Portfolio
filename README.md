# Bootstrap-Portfolio
Recreation of my portfolio using  Bootstrap

Used some additional extra css as well to get some spacing right~

I touched a little upon this in my index.html commentary, however the only issue that I have with my boot strap implementation is I can't quite get my NavBar scaling right for smaller screens. The links cut off. I've tried implementing a toggler button dropdown for small screens (when the button is pushed, a drop down appear with the links to my other pages). However thgat appears to draw upon some jquery scripts, and I couldn't quite get that to work, so I removed it entirely. Going to work on this a bit more later.

Overall, I really liked using bootstrap. Super powerful tool there!
